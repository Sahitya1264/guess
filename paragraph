This is a simple HTML-based Bus Ticket Reservation form that collects basic information from the user. It includes a heading and a form with input fields for the passenger's name, destination, and number of tickets. The user is required to enter their name in a text box to identify themselves. A dropdown menu allows the user to select a destination from three available options: City A, City B, or City C. There is also a number input field where the user can choose how many tickets they want to reserve, limited between 1 and 10. The form uses basic HTML attributes like required to ensure no field is left empty before submission. Once filled, the user can click the "Reserve Tickets" button to submit the form. The action="/submit" and method="post" indicate that the form data will be sent to a server-side script or handler located at /submit. However, since this version is pure HTML, it does not include any processing or feedback. It only provides a static structure for collecting user input.
