This program creates a simple number guessing game that runs in a web browser. When the page loads, it generates a random number between 1 and 99 using JavaScript. The user is prompted to enter their guess into an input box and click the “Guess” button. When the button is clicked, the checkGuess function reads the user’s input and checks if it is a valid number within the allowed range. If the guess is too low, it tells the user to guess higher; if it’s too high, it advises to guess lower. If the guess matches the randomly chosen number, it congratulates the user for guessing correctly. After each guess, the input box is cleared and focused so the user can easily type the next guess. The feedback is displayed dynamically below the input area to guide the user. This simple interactive game demonstrates how HTML elements and JavaScript logic can work together to create engaging user experiences directly in the browser. The program doesn’t limit the number of guesses, so the user can keep trying until they find the right answer. Overall, it’s a beginner-friendly example combining basic web technologies with simple game logic.
